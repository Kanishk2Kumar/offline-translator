#Prerequisties:
To start with, install whisper.cpp, portaudio and VB-Cable


# Simple Project Overview & Idea:
Offline AI Language Translator & Interpreter
What it does:
– Instantly translates text (via camera/OCR) and speech between languages—no cloud required.
– Speak into your PC mic or hold up a sign/poster to the webcam and get real‑time translated subtitles or voice playback.

Edge AI tech:

On‑device OCR + NMT (neural machine translation) models (quantized transformer).

Local TTS/STT pipeline (Whisper.cpp + TinyLlama‑based translator + Coqui TTS).

Everyday Value:

Travelers in areas without Wi‑Fi/roaming.

Language learners practicing in real contexts.

Qualcomm Win:

Highlights NPU‑accelerated vision+NLP fusion, low‑latency audio pipelines, and the versatility of the AI Engine.

## it should be able to integrated into meetings(zoom, etc) such that the client can speak in different language and at the same time get the translated version of different audios
